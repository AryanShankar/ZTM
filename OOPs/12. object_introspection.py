print(dir(list))

'''
introspection in computer programming means the ability to determine the type of an object at runtime.

It gives us all the methods and attributes that the item has access to.
But we get this functionality with IDEs build in, when we type item or instance name dot
for eg.
list. 
and then IDE will pop a window with all the methods and attributes it has access to.
