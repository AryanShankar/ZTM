In pure functions data and methods are seen as 2 different things and are kept seperate unline in oops concept where both are together defined in a class.

Pure functions are functions that will always provide the same output for the same input.
Pure fucntions shud not affect the outside world. 
eg. it shudnt use outside variables, it shudnt print anything

This is just a concept, actaully having only pure functions is not viable.
